
# For loops allow us to loop over (iterate) a collection of items (ex. letters in a string, arrays, series of numbers)

# STRINGS EXAMPLE
# for letter in 'Blackets in Space':
#     print(letter)

# ARRAY EXAMPLE
# if for looping in a list, you will print out each element of the array/list
# friends = ['Alex', 'John', 'Mark', "Billy"]

# for fdsa in friends:
#     print(fdsa)


# if for looping in a list and you are printing out the array/list, you will print out the list however many elements are in that list

# friends = ['Alex', 'John', 'Mark', "Billy"]

# for fdsa in friends:
#     print(friends)

# INTEGER EXAMPLE
# for fdsa in range(10):
#     print(fdsa)
